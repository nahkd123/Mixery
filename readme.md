# Mixery
An open source Digital Audio Workspace. Mixery uses Web Audio API to render audio in realtime, as well as rendering it to audio file.

## Try Mixery
Haven't found a website hosting page yet. Maybe I'll use GitHub Page soon. (or maybe Heroku...)

## How to build?
0. Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm. For Windows users, npm is already included in NodeJS installer. For Linux users, you'll need to install it via package manager (ex: ``sudo apt install npm``)
1. Clone this repository: ``git clone https://github.com/nahkd123/Mixery.git``
2. Install ``typescript`` npm module: ``npm i typescript``
3. Type ``tsc`` to compile.

> You can also use ``tsc --watch`` while editing source codes so it will automagically compile files.

## Source Code License
The entire source code licensed under GPL v3.0. More information can be found in [here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) or view in ``LICENSE`` file.

## Why free?
The main reason is because I want to make music. If you take a look at DAW market, you can see almost every DAW are quite expensive (starting from $100). Some are free but with old user interface (look like it's from 2005). Oh and many people also wanted to make music as well.

## FAQ...?
### Do I need a license to use this for commercial use?
No. Just simply use this DAW and gain profit from it. **s t o n k s**
